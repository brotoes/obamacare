    Returns a list of persons' id, name and emails

--- /home

    Returns a list of records that can be searched through
    Applied three styles of ranking (sorting) in the project definition

        These rankings are done with the function 'apply_filter' in utilties.py
        'apply_filter' is fairly generic and can be applied to any list of
        tuples.

        First, it takes a filter_str, which is a space separated list of
        keywords. It then takes a list of tuples. This is the list that is
        searched through. 
        
            Then it takes a list of column titles. These label the
        indices of each tuple in items. If a column is None, it is not searched
        through.

            The optional argument 'method' determines which ranking system it
        will use.

        Finally, it uses a bunch of for loops and python magic to return a
        list of tuples sorted by rank

--- /person/{id}

    Shows the information of a person corresponding to 'id'

--- /profile

    Allows the user to view and edit their own information

--- /login /logout

    Self explanatory: visit these URLs to log in and out

--- /record/{id}

    view a record's information and images

--- /i/{id}

    view and image of size dictated by GET argument 's=[t,r,f]'

--- /images/{id}

    returns images that are attached to the record if id 'id'

--- /olap

    returns a count of images per patient, test type, and per week

    fields are only considered when they are passed in. if no fields are passed
    in, the total number of images is returned.
        if a person is passed in, it shows the number of images related to that
        patient. if the person field is an asterisk, it shows the images for
        each person individually

        similarly, if a test type is passed is, it shows the number images taken
        with that test type. if an asterisk is passed in, it shows the images
        for each test type. 

        When multiple fields are asterisks, it will show totals for every
        combination.

        The user may also choose to group by week, month, and year.

        if a field is blank, its corresponding column in the results table will
        not be shown

--- /report

    Allows the user to get a list of patients who, betwen the time of start an
    end were diagnosed with a specified diagnosis


Queries.py
*** Only listing functions whose behaviour is not clear, or clearly defined by
    its doc strings

--- get_cube()
    returns a query for the join of RadiologyRecord, PacsImage, and Person.
    This function is used by the OLAP view to get image counts based on test
    type, test date, person name and time periods

--- get_records()
    This function returns a list of tuples, where the tuples are the required
    information of a record. Its optional arguments are used to search through
    this list. The search is performed by 'apply_filter'. Leaving optional
    arguments as None makes the search open ended. for example, only providing
    start, but not end, will give all results after 'start' date, until the end
    of time.

--- get_report()
    This function returns a list of Person and RadiologyRecords for use in the
    /report view. Where it is filtered by 'start' and 'end' dates and
    'diag_filter'.
